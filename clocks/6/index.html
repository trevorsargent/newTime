			<h1>Base 10</h1>
			<p>While some argue that we should move to a base 12 approach in the rest of our daily life, the digital clock remains one
				of the only international measures not calculated in a base 10 system.</p>
			<p>This clock counts 10 hours to a day, 100 minutes to an hour, 100 seconds to a minute.</p>
			<p>The most surprising thing to me was the fact that the rhythm of seconds ticking by was only slightly different from their
				current rate. Additionally, our day to day notions of would also not change drastically, with 15 base 10 minutes lasting
				about 21 base 12 minutes, and a new hour lasting about 85 old minutes</p>
