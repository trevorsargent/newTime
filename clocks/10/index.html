			<h1>Color Time</h1>

			<p>A nod to the platform on which these clocks are being made, here I'm taking advantage of the way that color is represented
				in a digital context.</p>
			<p>Each 'digit' of the time (though in this case, it's mostly irrelevant whether it's analog or digital) is fed into one
				of the color parameters for the clock's face. </p>
			<p>Color is calculated in 3 bytes, 1 per color. Each measure (hours|minutes|seconds) are mapped from their own range (0-24
				for hours, 0-60 for the others) to a scale from 0 to 255 (the maximum value for any component of a color on the web</p>
			<p>The 'hours' control the red, the 'minutes' the green, and the 'seconds' the blue. The result is a unique color for every
				time of day, that moves through the whole color space in a jagged, seemingly random, but completely organized way. </p>
